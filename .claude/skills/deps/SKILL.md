Audit and manage project dependencies: $ARGUMENTS

If no specific action requested, run the full audit.

## Step 1 — Read Current Dependencies
Read the requirements file. List all packages with their current version constraints.

## Step 2 — Check Installed Versions
```bash
pip list --format=columns
```
Compare installed versions against requirements constraints.

## Step 3 — Vulnerability Scan
```bash
pip audit
```
If `pip-audit` is not installed:
```bash
pip install pip-audit && pip audit
```
Report any known CVEs with severity, affected package, and fixed version.

## Step 4 — Check for Outdated Packages
```bash
pip list --outdated --format=columns
```
For each outdated package, report:
- Current version
- Latest version
- Whether the update is a major/minor/patch bump
- Risk assessment (major bumps may have breaking changes)

## Step 5 — Compatibility Check
For any proposed upgrades:
- Check if the new version supports the project's Python version
- Check for known incompatibilities between upgraded packages
- Verify framework version compatibility

## Step 6 — Apply Upgrades (if requested)
If user asked to upgrade:
1. Update version constraints in the requirements file
2. Install updated packages
3. Run the test and type-check commands (see project config)
4. If tests fail after upgrade, identify which package caused the failure and roll back that specific upgrade
